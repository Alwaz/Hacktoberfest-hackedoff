// Java Comments
Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.

Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).

Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by Java (will not be executed).

This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:

// This is a comment
System.out.println("Hello World");

System.out.println("Hello World"); // This is a comment



// Java Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.

Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by Java.

This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code:



/* The code below will print the words Hello World
to the screen, and it is amazing */
System.out.println("Hello World");
